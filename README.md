# Wealins Eventtia
A bunch of custom CSS Modules

## What is it?

This repository is made to group some custom CSS that are directly imported into Wealins Eventtia websites for customization of their event websites.

## How does this work?

Into the component folder, you'll find one HTML document for one CSS document (module).
In the root folder, the index is just here to link to the different components available.
